For a newbie to multi CPU processing, I&nbsp;have to say that the python 2.7 documentation is difficult to understand at best and incomplete at worst. &nbsp;Searching the web I came across two tutorials that I found to be very helpful.<br /><br />The first is by <a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/multiprocessing/index.html">Doug Hellmann</a> in his Python Module of the Week series (PyMOTW), he gave much clearer examples of how the multiprocessing module worked.<br /><br />However, I still needed more information. &nbsp;I found enough to get me over the hump in solving my problem from <a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/158/PLN/ParProcBook.pdf">Norman Matloff's</a>&nbsp;(pdf link) tutorial from UC Davis, called "Programming on Parallel Machines". &nbsp;Chapter 3 is called "The Python Threads and Multiprocessing Modules". &nbsp;Not exhaustive, but very helpful. &nbsp;I will probably be referring to it again as I move the code from a single multiprocessor machine to a cluster.<br /><br />Other information on other types of Parallel Processing (Cluster, Cloud, Grid) and the related python libraries can be found here at the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing">PythonWiki</a>
