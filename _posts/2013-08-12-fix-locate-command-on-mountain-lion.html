So apparently upgrading to the Macintosh system Mountain Lion (10.8) breaks the unix "locate" command because it deletes the "nobody" user that was used to own the database.  I found this <a href="https://gist.github.com/zbowling/3318310"><b>gist</b></a> that gives instructions how to get it working again. However, in my case I also had to enable the root user and then log in as root in Terminal and run the command   /usr/libexec/locate.updatedb  as root. Then it finally worked. Sheesh.
