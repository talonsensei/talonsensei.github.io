I want to set up the <code style="background-color: #eeeeee;">shiny-server</code> to run on an iMac at work so that we can run multiple R-apps over the intranet. According to the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server">docs</a> for Shiny server, OSX is not supported yet (version 1.1.0) so we are going to build it from source and hope for the best!   <br /><br />Instructions for building from source are <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-server/wiki/Building-Shiny-Server-from-Source">here</a>. We follow them pretty closely but there are a few gotchas.<br /><br />The full HowTo is on our GitHub Wiki,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/talonsensei/codex-python/wiki/Howto-Install-Shiny-Server-on-OSX">here</a>
